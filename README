    Definition

        The MIMEfield project is a simple tool to determine if the extension
        of a file matches with the expected MIME type.

    Requirements

        Python framework

            In order to run the latest version of MIMEfield, the Python 3.x
            framework (version 3.2 or higher is recommended) must be installed
            on the system.

            If you need a version for the Python 2.x framework for whatever
            reason, you can try refactoring the syntax from Python 3.x to
            version 2.x using the 3to2 (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/3to2)
            tool.

            However, there is no guarantee that this works properly or at all.

        Additional packages

            Furthermore, you need the 'libmagic' file type identification
            library. Details can be found here:

                https://pypi.org/project/python-magic
